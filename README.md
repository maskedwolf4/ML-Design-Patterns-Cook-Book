ML Design Patterns Cook Book

**Description:**

This repository provides a collection of Python code examples demonstrating various design patterns applied to machine learning (ML) tasks. These patterns can help improve code readability, maintainability, and flexibility in ML projects.

**Contents:**

* **creational_patterns:**
    * **factory_method:** Examples of using the Factory Method pattern to create different ML models based on configuration.
    * **abstract_factory:** Examples of using the Abstract Factory pattern to create families of related ML components.
    * **singleton:** Examples of using the Singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of a class exists, such as for global configuration or resources.
* **structural_patterns:**
    * **adapter:** Examples of using the Adapter pattern to adapt existing ML components to different interfaces.
    * **composite:** Examples of using the Composite pattern to represent hierarchical structures of ML components, such as pipelines or ensemble models.
    * **decorator:** Examples of using the Decorator pattern to add new responsibilities to ML components dynamically, such as data augmentation or regularization.
* **behavioral_patterns:**
    * **strategy:** Examples of using the Strategy pattern to encapsulate different algorithms for a task, such as different optimization algorithms or loss functions.
    * **observer:** Examples of using the Observer pattern to notify multiple components when a change occurs, such as when a model is updated or a metric changes.
    * **iterator:** Examples of using the Iterator pattern to iterate over elements of ML collections, such as datasets or model parameters.
